ἓ Ι. SELEUCIA on the Tiaris.

Strabo says: ‘ ¹ ln former times the capital of Assyria was Babylon;
it is now called Seleucia upon the Tigris. Near ir is a large village
called Ctesiphon. This the Parthian kinoes usually made their winter
residence, with a view to sparing rhe Seleucians rhe burden ol furnish-
ing quarters lor the Scythian soldiery. In consequence of the power
of Parthia, Ctesiphon may be considered as a city rather than ι
village, from its sive it is capable of lodging a great multitude of
people; it has been adorned with public buildings by the Parthians
and has furnished merchandise and given rise tn ans profitable to its
masters The kinzs usually passed the winter there, on account of
the salubrity of the air, and the summer at Ecbatana and in Hymnia,
induced by the ancient renown of thffie places. (XXI, 1, 16.)

“Babylon . . t t is situated in a plain ..... The tornb ol
Belus is there. At present it ix in ruins, having been demolished, as

what he had attempted, belore disease hurried him r-apirlly to his end.
Nune ol the persons who succeeded him amended to this undertaking;
other works also were neglected, and the city was dilapidated, partly
by the Persians, partly by rime, find through the indifference ul the
Macedonians to things ot this kind, particularly alter Seleucus Nicator
had fortilied Seleucia on the Tigris near Babylon, at the distance ol
about ³00 stadia.

“Both this prince and all his successore directed their care m
thar city, and transferred to it the seat of empire. At presenr it is
larger than Babylon, which is in great part deserted .....

“On account of the scarcity of timber, the beams and pillarx of
the houses are made ol' palm wood. They wind ropes of twisted
reed round the pillars, paint them over with colors and draw designs
upon them3 they cover the dours with a coat nl asphaltum. These
are losty and all the houses are vaulted on account of the want ol
timber. For the country is bare; a great part of it is covered wirh
shrubs and produces nothing bur the palrn. This trec grows in the
greatest abundante in Babylonia ..... They do not use tiles sor
their houses, because there are no grear rains. (XVI, l¹ 5,)

“The country is intersected by many rivers, the-larges: of which

are the Euphrates and the Tigris ..... The Tigris is navigablc
