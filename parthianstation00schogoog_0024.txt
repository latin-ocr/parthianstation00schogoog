NOTES

SUMMARY. The SCHOENUS ur Parasang was a Persian
measure, perhaps not altogether fixed, and may be calculated as some>
where between 33( and 3½ miles; more or less, perhaps, nn liour’s
travel by cauvun. According to stabo, it wax equa! tn 40 stadia,
but varied from 30 to 60,

<strabo XV, 1, 11.) “When lamnae-1 me hu1³,me mames
of these schoeni were not everywhere uniform, so that the same nurn-
ber sometimes designated a greater, sometimes a less actual extent of

mad, ,ι mimo„ which dms from me earliest time and exim in our
days. ⁷¹

Masson notes Isidore's schoenus in Persia was about 2½ miles 5
on the Euphrates, 331. Cf. Herodotus Ι, 66,

The STATHMOS was also a measure of diszance, but irregu—
lar, depending on the nature ol the country and the capability of the
beasts uf burden.

Athenaeus (XI, 103) speaks οί Amyn-as as me author of a work
on the Stations of Asia3 Eratosthenes based sume oi his geographici-l
calculations on the “ Reaisrer of rhe Stnthmi.'’

The modern FARSAKH in Persia is approximately the same,
3½ to 4 ηιῦεε, >

In general the route followed in Isidore's itiner-ary is (rom
Antioch to Biriiik, thence down the Euphraten 1⁰ Hit and across to
Seleucia on ιΙιε Tigris, a short distance below Bagdad3 thence by
the modern cat-avan route from Bagdad to Hamadan. Telieran and
Nishamr, thence nouxhward to Hera( and Lake Helmund, and east>
ward to Kandahar.

ἓ Ι. ZEUGMA and APAMIA (not to be confused with the
Zeugma by Thapsacus where Alexander crossed the :iven cf. Strabo,
XVI, 1, 23. Zeugma means simply ford, ur crossing).

This is mentioned by Pliny, V, 213 “Zeugma, 72 miles from
Samosata, a fine crossing of the Euphrates. Seleucus Nicator joined
it to Apamia un the opposite bank by a bridoee.¹’

Strabo mentions not Apamia, but Seleucia a: opposite Zeugma
(XVI, 2, 3); to Polybius V, ⁴3, 1.

Stephanus Byz. speaks of ⁴¹ Seleucus by Apamia in Syrizff’

Pliny (vl, 30), speaks of Apamia alone.
