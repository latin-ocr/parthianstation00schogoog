COMMENTARY

The Parthian Stati-ns oi Isidore of Charax, fragmennry as ir is,
is one uf the very few records of the overland ‹rader-oure in the period
oi sunnio between Parthia and Rome⁴ As the title indicates, it gives
an itinerary oi the car-avan irai] irum stnrioch to rhe borders oi India,
naming the supply statinus, or, as they would now be called, the
caravanserais maintained by the Parthian Governmenr ior the con-
venience of merchanu. While the record conrains little inore than
the names of the statione and the intervening distances, an examina-
κίοι-ι of rhe route followed leads ro numerous inierences concerning
the relarions oi the Parthian monarchy with irs subiect states and with
neighborinn foreign powerx.

This record rnay be dated from inmernal evidence as oi the reign
oi Augustus, probably very close to the Christian era⁴ In its manu-
script form, rhe Parthian Sturiom seems to be a rnere summary or
transcription froin some larger work, and another extract quoted by
Athenaeus und ascribed ro Isidore, mentions the xitle as a “Journey
around Parthia,'' while various iragmentsquoted in the Namalfflnm
of Pliny indicate thar Isidore was the author of some general work
on geography. His very home is a maner of inference⁴ The manu-
script speaks of him as Isidore “ol Charax‚'’ which means merely ⁴
“ palisaded town.¹' But ir seems clear tharihe place meant is Charax
Spasini, the commercia! port at the head oi rhe Persian Guli, und C.
Mi'iller point: our that the author oi the “description uf the world⁰
mentioned by Pliny (Vl, 31) as having been commissioncd by Auzusms
“to zarher all necessary informa-tion in the easr when his eldest son
was about to set out for Armenia to take the command against the
Parthians and Arabians.¹¹ is no other than our Isidore. The manu-
script of Pliny in that place refers this work ro Dionysius, but as both
Miiller and Bernhardy have shown, rhis is a mimke and Isidore is
probably meant,

Aa to the date of the work oi Isidore, as it mentions the secund
revolution oi Tiridates against the Parthian king Phraates, which took
place in 26 B. C., it must he luter than rhar date; and a subsequenx
reference to a king named Goaesus of the ¹¹ Incense Land ’¹ in Smnh
Arabia, while his dates are not definitely known, suggens w Glaser
has shown, a tirne very near «he Christian eru⁴
