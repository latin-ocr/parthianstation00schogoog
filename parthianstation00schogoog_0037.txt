Strabo says oi this region generally (XV¹ 2-8):

“The grater part of the country inhabited by the Icthyophagi
is on a level with the sea No trees except palme and akind οἱ thom,
and the tamarisk grow there. There ir also a scarcity oi water and
of lood produced by cultivation. Both they and their cattle subsisc
upon lish and are supplied hy rain water and wells. The flesh οἱ the
animalx has the srnell oi fish. Their dwellinns are built with the
bones oi large whales and shells, the ribs furnishing banis and sup-
pom, and the jaw-bones door-ways. The vertebra! bones serve as
rnomrs in which lish, which have been previously dried in the sun,
are pounded. Ol this, with the addition ot fleur, cakes are made5
for they have grindint mills (lor corn), although they have no iron.
This, however, is not so sumrising, because it is possible for them to
imponit from other μηδ. But how do they hollow out the milis
anain when worn away? With the same stenes, they say. with which
their arrows and iavelins, which are hardened in the fire are sharpened.
Some fish are dressed in ovens, but the greater part is eaoen ravv. The
fish are taken in nets made of rhe barlt of the pali-n.

the rest oi Asia. As it is without truits and water, except in summer,
it is not much better than the country oi the Icthyophagi* But it
produces aromatics, particularly nard and myrrh,. in such quantity that

“The summer was purposely chosen tor leaving India, for ar
that naason it mins in Gedrosia, and the rivers and wells are filled, bur
in wimer they fail. The rain falls in the higher paris to the north,
and near the mom-mim when the rivers fill, the plains near the sea
arc watered, and the wells ase also filled. Alexander sent persons
before him into the desert country ro dig wells and to prepare satiens
for himself and his fleet.
