FROM ISIDORE’S DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD

21. (Pliny, Natural History, II, 112.) “Our part o( the
arth, of which 1 propose to give an account, floating as it
were in the ocean which surrounds it, stretches out to the
greatest extent from eust to west, viz, from India to the
Pium consecrated to Hercules at Gades, being a disunce of
8568 miles, according to the statement of Artemidorus, or
according to that of Isidore, 9818 miles.'’

22. (Ibid.,11‚ 112.) “The breadth of the earth from south
to north, is commonly supposed to be about one-half only of
its length, viz. , 4490 miles;'’ (then follow parts of these
measurements from the southern extremlties to the mouth of
Tanais). “Beyond the Tanais the most diligent authors have
not been able to obtain any accurate measurement. Artemi-
dorus supposes that everything beyond is undiscovered, since
he confesses that, about the Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmatae
dwell, who extend toward the North Pole. Isidore adds 1250
miles, as the distance to Thule; but this is mere conjectures

23. (Ibid.‚ V, 9.) “The whole distance (of Asia) to the
Tanais, including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus and
Isidore, 6375 miles.

24. (Ibid., IV, ³7.) “Artemidorus and Isidore have given
the length οἱ it (Europe) from the Tan-is to Gades, as 8214
miles.”

25. (Ibid.; V, 6.) “Isidore speaks of the distance lrorn
Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles. Artemidorus makes
this last distance forty miles less than Isidore.¹ ' γ

-26, - (Ibid. V, 43.) “From Chalcedon to Sigeum, Isidore
makes the distance 322½ milesff¹

27. (ΖΜΔ, V, 35.) “Timosthenes states that the circurn-
ference of this island [Cyprus] is 427 miles, Isidore ³75.”

28. ΗΜΛ, V, 36.) “The fairest of them all is the free
islandus Rhodes, 125, orif we would rather believe Isidore,
103 miles in circumference ....... It is distant from
Alexandria in Egypt, according tu Isidore, 583 miles; but ac-
cording to Eratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says that its distance
§rom Cyprus is 166.”
