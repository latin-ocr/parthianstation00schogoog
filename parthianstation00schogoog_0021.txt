route sketched by Isidore, ending at Antioch; and it is interesting to
nore that the Parthian route includes the space between Knndahar and
Lake Helmund, which had also to he traveled by those hound ior the
Persian Gull, lt is clear that the sonarem kingdom tributary to the
Parthian state were in large masura independent in their commercial
affairs, and that some understanding to this effera existed with the
Parthian mpirah otherwise the diver-sion of trade between the noi-them
and southern mutes ιι Lake Helmund could not peacefully have
occurred* ’

The Parthian Statium marks the ancient tradbroute of the Medes
and the Assyriam. The risae ol the power oi Persia diverred much
oi the trade to the Royal Road, leading ro Susa and thence to Lake
Helinnnd. Under the Parthians it was evidently a state policy to
encourage the passage of goods from Lake Helmund over the old
northern roure 5 but the understandinz between the Kushan monarchy
and the Nabutaean princes made it impracticahle ior Parthia to
establish a con-mercial monopoly through its capital on the Tigris

We may infer that the author of the Journey Arvund Panhia,
meaning the Parthian Empire, described both these imponant over—
land highways. lt is very regrettable that his work should have
perished except in fugitive quotations, and that we have remaining
only a brief itiner-ary of the northem route.

The policy ol the Roman Empire during the two centur-ies
following rhe Christian era was to encourage direct sea trade with
India, cutting out all overland routes through Parthia and thus avoiding
the annoyance of fiscal dependence on that consistent enemy or Rome.

In connection with the work of Isidore, the relations between
Parthia and Rome immediately preceding his time may be borne in
mind. When Crassus became consul in Rome in 55 B. C„ he was
appointed ιο command in the east, his headquarters being at Antioch,
rhe former Seleucid capital; and he announced his intention of carry-
ing the Roman arms to Bactria, India and the eastern ocean. The
Arab sheilths bordering on the province of Syria, some ot whom had
been allied with Rome, changed sides as they did not desire further
aggressions from the west. Crassus crussed the Euphrates at Zeugma,
where the Parthian Smnionr begins irs account. Instead of following
the road to Edessa and Armenia at the font of the hills or keeping
close to the Euphrates river, he marched straight overland, still along
