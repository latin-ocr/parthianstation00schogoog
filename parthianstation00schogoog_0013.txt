JOURNEY AROUND PARTH {A

20. (Afragrnent quoted from Athenaeus, III, 46.) Isidore
of Charax in his description oi Parthia says there is n certain
island in the Persian Gulf where many pearls are found; and
that round about the island there are rans made of reeds, from
which men dive into the sea to 3 depth οἱ 20 fathoms and
bring up double-shelled oysters. They say that when there
are frequent thunderstorrns and heavy rains, the oyster pro-
duces the most young, and they get the most, the best 3ηά the
largest pearls; and in the winter the shells are accustomed to

¹ sink into holes in the bottom, but in the summer they swim

 

about all night with their shells open, hut they close in the day-
time. And when they cling to stones 3ηά rocks in the wnvoe
they take root and then, remaining fixed, produce the penrls.
These are engendered and nourished by something that adheres
to their flesh. lt grows in the mouth of the oyster and has
claws 3ηά brings in food. It is like a small crab and is called
“Guardizn ot the oyster.'’ Its flesh penenztes through the
center of the shell like a root; the pearl being engendered
close to it, grows through the solid portion oi the shell and
keeps growing as long as it continues to adhere to the shell.
But when the flesh gets under the excrescence and cuts its way
onward, it gendy separates the pearl §rom the shell and then,
when the pearl is surrounded by flesh, it is no longer nourished
in such manner as to grow further, but the flesh makes it
smoother‚ more transparent and more pure. And when the
oyster lives at the bottom, it produces the clearest and largest
pearls; but those that float on the surface, because they are
affected by the ruys oi the sun, produce smaller pearls, oi
poorer color. The pearl divers run into danger when they
thrust their hands straight into the open oyster, for it closes up
and their fingere are often cut off, and sometimes they perish
on the spon but those who take thern by thrusting their hands
under from one side, easily pull the shells off from the rocks.
