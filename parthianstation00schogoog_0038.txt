Nearchus and Onesicritus, his maner pilot, giving them orden to take
up convenient positions in following him. and ιο nil along tbe coast
pai-allelu: his line of marchr'?

In anorher semion (XV, 2, 5), Strabo observes:

‘⁴ Nearchus mys that while Alexander was on his march, he hirn⁴
welf commenced his voyage, in the autumn, about the achronical rising ι
of the Pleiades, the wind not being before favor-able. The Barbarians
however, taking courage at the departure οί the king, became daring,
and attempted to throw off their subjeefion, anacked rhem and
endeavored tu drive thern out of rhe country. But Craterus set out
frou-n the Hydaspes, and proceeded through the country οἱ rhe Ara-
choti und of the Drangae into Carmania

“Alexander was greatly distrested «hrmnahout the whole πικρὴ,
as his road lay through a barren counny. The supplies of provisions
which he obtained carne lrom a distance and were scanty and un-
frequent, so much so thar the army suffered greatly from hunger, the
δεῦτε of burden dropped down und the bama-ge was abandoned, both
on the march and in the camp. The army was saved by eating dares
und the marrow ol the palm tree.

‘⁴ Alexander, however (says Nearchus), although acquaimed with
the hardzhips of the enterprise, was ambitious of conducting this large
army in κίειν, as a conqueror, through the same country where, ac-
cording to the prevailinz repon, Semiramis escaped by ssight from
India with about twenty and Cyrus with about neven men. '’

This is the modern trude route from Al'oehanisnn by Lake Hel-
munael and Kerrnan to the head of due Persian Gull.

Strabo, (XI, 8, 8-9) further observes:

‘⁸ Eratosthenes says 1th the Bactrinns lie along the Arachoti and
Massagetae on the west neanhe Oxus, and thar the Sacae and Sogdiani,
through the whole extent ol their territory, are opposite ro India, but
the Bamrii in part only, for the greater part of their country lies
parallel to the Pampamisus3 that the Sacz and Sogdiani are separated
by the Iaxartes, and the Sogdiani and Bactriani by the Oxus; that
Tapyri occupy tbe country between the Hyrcani and Arii; thar around
the shores of the sea. next xo (he Hyrcani, are Amardi, Anariacae,
Cadusii, Albani, Caspii, Vitii, and perhaps other tribes extending as
§arasthe Scythiam that on the other uide of rhe Hyrcani are Derbices,
that the Caducii are contioeuous both to the Medes and Matiani below
the Panchonthru.
